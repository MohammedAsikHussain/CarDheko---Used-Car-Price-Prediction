# CarDheko---Used-Car-Price-Prediction

## Introduction:
The Used Car Price Prediction project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. This helps buyers, sellers, and dealerships in making informed decisions.\

## Project Overview :  

### Objective:
Develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting used car prices based on comprehensive vehicle attributes. The aim is to enhance customer engagement and optimize pricing strategies.

### Scope:
Utilize data from various cities, incorporating features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. The final deliverable will be an interactive web application that provides instant price predictions, accessible to both customers and sales teams.


## Skills:
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Machine Learning
4. Model Development
5. Streamlit Application

## Project Work Flow:
### 1. Data Processing

Data Integration: Merge datasets from multiple cities into a unified, structured format.
Missing Value Treatment: Apply appropriate imputation techniques for both numerical and categorical fields.
Data Standardization: Normalize values (e.g., units, formats) and encode categorical variables for consistency.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization: Explore data visually to uncover patterns, distributions, and anomalies.
Feature Selection: Identify and prioritize key variables that significantly influence car pricing.

### 3. Model Development
Algorithm Selection: Train and compare regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Implement Grid Search to fine-tune model parameters for better performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation & Optimization
Performance Metrics: Evaluate model accuracy using MAE, MSE, and R-squared scores.
Feature Engineering: Refine features and create new ones to improve predictive accuracy.

### 5. Deployment
Streamlit Web Application: Deploy an interactive app that offers real-time price predictions based on user inputs.
User Interface Design: Create a clean, user-friendly experience for both customers and sales representatives.

## Project Insights:
Key Features Matter: Variables such as car age, mileage, and overall condition were among the most influential factors in predicting accurate car prices.

Data Preprocessing Impact: Effective handling of missing values and consistent feature standardization were critical to achieving high model performance and reliability.

User-Friendly Deployment: The Streamlit application enables seamless user interaction, making real-time price predictions accessible and intuitiveâ€”enhancing both customer experience and team efficiency.
